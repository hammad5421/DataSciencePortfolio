Google Cloud's BigQuery is a great tool for data scientists to quickly and easily augment their datasets with external data. Specifically, BigQuery has a [listing of public datasets](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data) from a variety of different sources. All you need is a Google Cloud account and some basic SQL knowledge.

Here are just a few useful public datasets:

- [US Census American Community Survey](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/united-states-census-bureau/acs)
- [COVID-19 Data from Google](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/bigquery-public-datasets/covid19-public-data-program)
- [NOAA Global Weather Data](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/noaa-public/gsod)
- [Public Domain Artworks from The Met](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/the-metropolitan-museum-of-art/the-met-public-domain-art-works)
- [Bitcoin Transaction Data](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/cmorqs-public/cmorq-bcd-data)

## A Quick Example

I think one of the most useful among the BigQuery public datasets is the US Census ACS data, which gives multi-year data broken down geographically (by state, zip code, county, etc.).

It has a lot of great demographic information like population (broken down by age, race, gender, marital status, etc.), education levels, employment, income, and much more.

For example, say I wanted to query the total population and median household income for three zip codes in the NYC area. There's a table called `zip_codes_2018_5yr` that gives a 5-year estimate of census data for the year 2018, broken down by zip code.

Here's what my query will look like:

```sql
SELECT 
  geo_id, -- Where geo_id is the zip code
  total_pop,
  median_income
FROM 
  `bigquery-public-data`.census_bureau_acs.zip_codes_2018_5yr
WHERE 
  geo_id in ("11377","11101","10708"); 
```

And I can run it in the BigQuery UI...

And get the following results...

Great! I got my answer in 0.4 seconds and now I can go back and expand my query to get this data for multiple years. Or, I can export the results to a CSV or JSON file to join it up with my data.

Finally, as a bonus, you can connect to BigQuery through Python with the package [google-cloud-bigquery](https://googleapis.dev/python/bigquery/latest/index.html).
